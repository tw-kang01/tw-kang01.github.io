## Introduction

I am an undergraduate student (Class of 2020) in the School of Software Convergence at Kyung Hee University.  
My research interests lie in **computer graphics**, **computer vision**, and **motion reconstruction**.

I am particularly interested in topics such as:

- 3-point tracking for human motion estimation  
- Full-body motion reconstruction from sparse signals  
- Environment-aware human motion modeling  
- Mixed Reality (AR/VR) systems and interaction  

My current goal is to understand emerging techniques in environment-aware motion AI, including diffusion-based motion synthesis, 3D scene understanding, and reconstruction pipelines involving Gaussian Splatting and SLAM-driven perception.

## Research

My research focuses on understanding and reconstructing human motion using minimal sensors and environmental context.  
I am actively exploring:

- Diffusion models for full-body motion generation (e.g., S2Fusion, SKEL, EnvAware models)  
- Gaussian Splatting for real-time environment capture  
- SLAM-based scene understanding for motion grounding  
- VR/AR interfaces for motion guidance and analysis  

I aim to develop robust pipelines for reconstructing realistic and physically-consistent human motion from sparse observations, enabling applications in VR, AR, sports analysis, and human-computer interaction.
